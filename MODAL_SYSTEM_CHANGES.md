# Modal System Implementation

## Overview
Replaced the right-side toast notifications (sonner) with centered modal dialogs for loading, success, and error states.

## New Components

### 1. LoadingModal (`components/ui/loading-modal.jsx`)
- Displays a spinner with a custom message
- Cannot be closed by user (no close button)
- Shows during async operations

### 2. StatusModal (`components/ui/status-modal.jsx`)
- Shows success (green checkmark) or error (red X) messages
- Includes title and message
- Has a close button
- Success modals auto-close after 3 seconds

### 3. useModal Hook (`hooks/useModal.js`)
- Manages loading and status modal states
- Methods:
  - `showLoading(message)` - Show loading modal
  - `hideLoading()` - Hide loading modal
  - `showSuccess(title, message)` - Show success modal (auto-closes in 3s)
  - `showError(title, message)` - Show error modal (manual close)
  - `closeStatus()` - Close status modal

## Updated Files

### Core Files
- `app/page.js` - Added modal system, replaced toast calls
- `components/ui/dialog.jsx` - Added `hideClose` prop for loading modal

### Hooks
- `hooks/useForms.js` - All form submissions now use modals
- `hooks/useAttendance.js` - Attendance marking uses modals
- `hooks/useNewFeatures.js` - All feature actions use modals

## Usage Pattern

```javascript
// Before (toast)
toast.success('Action completed!')
toast.error('Action failed!')

// After (modal)
modal.showLoading('Processing...')
modal.showSuccess('Success', 'Action completed!')
modal.showError('Error', 'Action failed!')
```

## Benefits
1. More prominent user feedback
2. Prevents user actions during loading
3. Consistent UX across all operations
4. Better error visibility
5. Professional appearance

## Notes
- Toast system (sonner) is still installed but no longer used in main app
- All async operations now show loading state
- Success messages auto-dismiss, errors require manual close
- Modal system is passed through props to child components
